This plugin provides the credential provider to use Google Cloud Platform OAuth Credentials (provided by the Google OAuth Plugin) to access source code from https://source.developer.google.com as well as https://*.googlesource.com. It supports both kinds of credentials provided by Google OAuth Plugin: Google Service Account from metadata as well as Google Service Account from private key.


1. In order to use a Git repository hosted on https://source.developer.google.com, your credential will need the scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/projecthosting.  Your service account will need to have access to the repository’s Google Cloud Platform project.

1. In order to use https://*.googlesource.com, your credential will need the scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gerritcodereview.  Your service account will need to be whitelisted by the maintainers of that repository.

Usage
===
First, configure your OAuth credentials per instructions from Google OAuth Plugin.

Then, when configuring the Git repository for your Jenkins job, if you enter a https://*.googlesource.com address in the “Repository URL” text area, your Credentials drop box will automatically be populated with credentials having the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gerritcodereview scope

Similarly, if you enter a https://source.developer.google.com Git repository, your Credentials box will be populated with credentials having the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/projecthosting scope.

Select the required credential, then your job is ready to go!
